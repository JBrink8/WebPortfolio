            Saying Hi
            <i style="font-size:large; font-weight: 200;">7/10/2023</i>
        </h1>
        <p>
            Today, while at the gym I had two vastly different interactions with people I am aquainted with. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            The first was with a guy that I have never been close with, but have know for a couple years now. Whenever we see each other 
            we catch up, and it is always friendly. I think everyone can agree that 
            this type of interaction is awesome and we all want more of them. They leave you feeling good, and they are just nice. Yet, 
            I find these converstation are become more and more rare.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            The second interation was with an individual that I have know for only for a few 
            months. See me and the second individual had discussed me comming on to help out with the technical side of his startup. 
            Now, I am not involved with his start up, as for a couple reasons I felt it was not a good fit for me, but I left the 
            converstation on good terms, and we had a friendly relationship. However, when I saw him today and went up to say hi, the 
            guy acted as though he did not know me. He acted at first if he did not know me, then was very short. I was a bit taken aback 
            we had been nothing but friendly before. Maybe he was just in a mood, or maybe he truly had forgot who I was (which I doubt seeing 
            as we had talked a few times about me helping out with his startup). I was definetly taken a bit aback, but it really isn't something 
            I will dwell on, well besides writing this blog post.

        <h2>Fear of Rejection</h2>
        <br/>
        <p> 
            I think that the second type of interation is becoming more and more common, and is increasingly harmful. I am a rather confident 
            person, so I am not afraid to go up to someone and say hi, but I know many people who are not. I think that the fear of rejection,
            or an odd interation where someone acts as though they do not know you, or are not interested in talking to you, is a big reason 
            why people are afraid to go up to someone and say hi. From my observation this fear is becoming more and more common. Now maybe this 
            is being propigated by our collective societal addiction to our smart phones, but that is not really my point here. My point is that 
            being more open to that possiblitiy of rejection or just a shitty interaction is important, more often than not the interation will be 
            like the first one I described. Does it sting a bit when someone acts as though they do not know you? Sure, but its not the end of the 
            world. I will forgot about that interaction by the time I wake up tomorrow. But that interation I had with the first guy, that will 
            stick with me for a while. I will remember that interation, and I will remember that he was friendly and that he was happy to see me. 
        </p>

        <h2>Takeaway</h2>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Being okay with putting yourself out there, and accepting that some interactions will not be great is important. I think that my mental 
            health has vastly improved in the last few years because I have become more okay with the idea of rejection. See I used to be overweight and 
            uncomfortable with myself, and that anxiety and discomfort led to me projecting that onto interactions I had with others. I was afraid to put myself out there 
            and to truly be myself, which led to my mental health suffering. Did people care about my weight? No, not really, but I did. I was afraid of being judged, 
            made fun of, and rejected. So, my message to anyone that happens upon this post is to go say hi to that guy you once had class with, or that girl/guy that 
            you have always had a crush on. The worst that can happen is they will be dismissive, and you will forget about it by the time you wake up tomorrow. But, 
            more likely is that you will have a good interaction, and your confidence will grow.
