            <h1>NSF ZEUS Laser Facility GÃ©rard Mourou Center for Ultrafast Optical Science</h1>
            <h2>Full Stack Development Intern</h2>
            <h4>Spring 2023 - Present</h4>
            ZEUS, short for Zettawatt Equivalent Ultrafast Pulse Laser System, will be the most powerful
            laser in the United States upon completion and opening in October 2023. Being National Science 
            Foundation funded, ZEUS will be used for a wide variety of research projects, meaning there
            needs to be a way for researchers to submit proposals to use the laser. This is where I come in.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            In May 2023 I joined the ZEUS team as a full stack development intern. My job is to develop crucial
            functionalities of the Web Portal which will be used by researchers to submit proposals to use the 
            laser. So far, I have developed the user registration, verification, login, password reset, forgot 
            password, email change and other key authorization functionalities. I am currently building help 
            ticket system for the site, utilizing gmail's API to receive help inquires and generate tickets. I 
            am also developing a web calendar display for researchers and lab staff to view planned lab usage. 
            I have been working with one lead developer, meaning that I have been able to get my hands dirty 
            with the whole site. The site has been developed with Python Flask, SQL, Javascript, CSS, Globus, 
            HTML, and other tools. I have learned tons about web development and am excited to continue to learn.

            <h1>Spark Electric Racing, Software Team</h1>
            <h2>Software Developer</h2>
            <h4>Winter 2023 - Present</h4>
            Spark is an student run electric motorcyle team. I am currently working 
            on the software team, where I am developing a data interpretation program for 
            the bike's hardware. This program will be used to analyze the bike's performance 
            and make adjustments to the bike's settings. I am also getting involved with
            building a web-scrapper tool for our business team to use to find potential sponsors.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Sense joining Spark I have found my community of fellow software devs at Michigan
            and would highly recommend joining Spark or another Wilson Center Project Team to 
            any students. Also, I love the fact that I get to work on not just any electric vehicle,
            but badass electric motorcycles, with FBS (the new bike being developed) being able to
            go 0-60 in less that 4 seconds and reach speeds over 150 mph. My favorite memories has
            got to be the seemingly endless supply of 'Starry' pop (soda for those outside of Michigan) 
            that we had due to a sponsorship with the company at the end of last semester.

            <h4>Winter 2023 - Present</h4>
            After several semesters with MSCG, I was selected to overhaul the clubs client aquisition
            strategy, which had been lacking in recent years. Throughout the Winter 2023 semester I 
            , alonside my team, researched operations of other consulting clubs through interviews and 
            surverys. Also, my team and me dug through the data of past clients, documents kept during 
            past aquisition cycles, and interviewed past members of the club involved in client aquisition.
            My team's findings are beggining to be implemented this summer as MSCG begins to reach out to 
            potential clients for the Fall 2023 semester.
            <h2>Consulting Analyst</h2>
            <h4>Fall 2021 - Winter 2023</h4>
            I joined MSCG back during first semester of my freshman year, so I have been involved in this 
            student organization my entire college career. As such, I have been able to work on some very 
            cool projects. In Winter 2022, I worked on a project for the New York Islanders, who were concerned 
            about attracting fans from all around the New York Metropolitan area to their brand new stadium. 
            My favorite project was working with the owner of the West Michigan Whitecaps and Traverse City 
            Pitspitters minor league baseball teams. We conducted an Economic Impact Report for both teams, 
            analyzing the affect the teams have had on their respective communities through the use of economic 
            multipliers, and a spatial analysis of properties surrounding the stadium (I began development of 
            my python package SpatDAPy to support this project). I was able to present to both of these clients 
            which was a great experience.
            MSCG has taught me tons about team work, management, public speaking, time management, and much much 
            more.

            <h1>University of Michigan Recreational Sports</h1>
            <h2>Personal Trainer</h2>
            <h4>Fall 2022 - Present</h4>
            I have been working as a Personal Trainer for the last year for the University of Michigan's Recreational 
            Sports Department. While here I have had the opprotunity to help more than 10 clients achieve there Fitness 
            goals. This job has tought me how rewarding teaching and mentorship are from the other side. I have been a 
            part of my clients' journeys to lose weight, gain muscle, and improve their overall health. Seeing my clients 
            become happier in there own bodies is something I will never get tired of. I have also learned a lot about 
            how to be a good teacher and mentor, and how to be a good listener.
            <br/>
            Aside from being extremely personally rewarding, personal training has taught me how to manage my time like never 
            before. I have juggled 7 clients while taking intensive programming courses and been in clubs. I have learned how 
            to always be on, as my clients are free to text/call me whenever with questions, so I need to be able to instantly 
            go "trainer mode" and get to helping them - its kinda like when the bat signal goes up, when I receive that text or 
            call my clients are normally at the gym at that instant, and I have a commitment to help them out. This is a skill 
            I have brought with me to other jobs and commitments, the ability to always be on, and always be ready to help.

            <h1>PyPI Published Package</h1>
            <h2>Personal Project</h2>
            <h4>Fall 2022 - Winter 2023</h4>
            SpatDAPy is a python package I developed to help with spatial analysis. I developed this package while working on a 
            consulting project with the Sport Consulting Group. Essentially, my team was tasked with literally drawing straight 
            lines on a map for 1300+ addresses in Grand Rapids - that way we could analyse the properties surrounding a stadium 
            to see if there was any data that suggested property values increased as proximity to the stadium increased. I thought 
            that I could apply my skills in Python to make this task far far faster.
            <br/>
            Starting off as a simple script, I quickly realized that I could make this into a package that could be used by anyone 
            could use. Basically, the package uses a class, which takes in a central address, a list of properties, and a radius. 
            The class then uses the GeoPy package and iteration to find the Straight Line Distance from all these properties to the 
            central address. Now, the user can input other data about these properties, then use a vairenty of funcitons to analyze the 
            surrounding area. This package cut 40+ work hours of plotting and statistical analysis into around 2 hours just to get the 
            property addresses and 1-2 hours to input manually the properties unfound by GeoPy. My next step is to be able to use the 
            central address and the radius to find all properties within that radius, then use the same functions to analyze the data.
            <br/>
            MSCG has been using this package for the last year, and will continue to use it for all future economic analysis reports 
            they publish for clients. The package is available on PyPI, and I have built a Google Colab tutorial for anyone to learn 
            the package, however niche. I want to grow the project and create dev documentation in the near future.

            <h1>Community Housing Network</h1>
            <h2>CERA Team Lead</h2>
            <h4>Spring 2022 - Summer 2022</h4>
            I worked as a team lead for the Coronavirus Emergency Rental Assistance (CERA) program at Community Housing Network (CHN) after 
            being asked to return to the program as a Team Lead by my supervisor Christina Kronenberg. I was responsible for 
            both providing daily support to my team and ensuring that the team was following standards. I was also responsible for 
            managing my own case-load of 25 clients per week, all of whom were relying on me to help them pay their rent and utilities or 
            else faced eviction. This experience was my first real experience managing individuals, and I learned a lot about how to be 
            of assistance, but also not be looming over the shoulders of my team at all time.
            <br/>
            <h2>CERA Specialist</h2>
            <h4>Summer 2021</h4>
            In this role I worked to divert the eviction of 25+ clients per week by providing them with financial assistance to pay their 
            rent and utilities. I was able to pay out over a quarter-million in assistance over the course of the summer, consistently meeting 
            weekly case goals. However, this job was highly challenging and emotionally stressful. I was working with clients who were facing 
            eviction if I messed up anything - I large responsibility to bear. I was taught that in a high stress job like this, organization 
            is the key to not screwing up. I became neurotic about documenting calls, emails, and other forms of communtication with 
            clients, their landlords, attorneys, courts, and more. I also furthered my ability to be empathetic and understanding of others, 
            which I believe has helped me greatly in my personal life and in team situations.
