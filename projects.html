            <h1>NSF ZEUS Laser Facility GÃ©rard Mourou Center for Ultrafast Optical Science</h1>
            <h2>Full Stack Development Intern</h2>
            <h4>Spring 2023 - Present</h4>
            ZEUS, short for Zettawatt Equivalent Ultrafast Pulse Laser System, will be the most powerful
            laser in the United States upon completion and opening in October 2023. Being National Science 
            Foundation funded, ZEUS will be used for a wide variety of research projects, meaning there
            needs to be a way for researchers to submit proposals to use the laser. This is where I come in.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            In May 2023 I joined the ZEUS team as a full stack development intern. My job is to develop crucial
            functionalities of the Web Portal which will be used by researchers to submit proposals to use the 
            laser. So far, I have developed the user registration, verification, login, password reset, forgot 
            password, email change and other key authorization functionalities. I am currently building help 
            ticket system for the site, utilizing gmail's API to receive help inquires and generate tickets. I 
            am also developing a web calendar display for researchers and lab staff to view planned lab usage. 
            I have been working with one lead developer, meaning that I have been able to get my hands dirty 
            with the whole site. The site has been developed with Python Flask, SQL, Javascript, CSS, Globus, 
            HTML, and other tools. I have learned tons about web development and am excited to continue to learn.

            <h1>Spark Electric Racing, Software Team</h1>
            <h2>Software Developer</h2>
            <h4>Winter 2023 - Present</h4>
            Spark is an student run electric motorcyle team. I am currently working 
            on the software team, where I am developing a data interpretation program for 
            the bike's hardware. This program will be used to analyze the bike's performance 
            and make adjustments to the bike's settings. I am also getting involved with
            building a web-scrapper tool for our business team to use to find potential sponsors.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Sense joining Spark I have found my community of fellow software devs at Michigan
            and would highly recommend joining Spark or another Wilson Center Project Team to 
            any students. Also, I love the fact that I get to work on not just any electric vehicle,
            but badass electric motorcycles, with FBS (the new bike being developed) being able to
            go 0-60 in less that 4 seconds and reach speeds over 150 mph. My favorite memories has
            got to be the seemingly endless supply of 'Starry' pop (soda for those outside of Michigan) 
            that we had due to a sponsorship with the company at the end of last semester.

            <h1>Michigan Sport Consulting Group</h1>
            <h2>Client Strategy Managerp</h2>
            <h4>Winter 2023 - Present</h4>
            After several semesters with MSCG, I was selected to overhaul the clubs client aquisition
            strategy, which had been lacking in recent years. Throughout the Winter 2023 semester I 
            , alonside my team, researched operations of other consulting clubs through interviews and 
            surverys. Also, my team and me dug through the data of past clients, documents kept during 
            past aquisition cycles, and interviewed past members of the club involved in client aquisition.
            My team's findings are beggining to be implemented this summer as MSCG begins to reach out to 
            potential clients for the Fall 2023 semester.
            <h2>Consulting Analyst</h2>
            <h4>Fall 2021 - Winter 2023</h4>
            I joined MSCG back during first semester of my freshman year, so I have been involved in this 
            student organization my entire college career. As such, I have been able to work on some very 
            cool projects. In Winter 2022, I worked on a project for the New York Islanders, who were concerned 
            about attracting fans from all around the New York Metropolitan area to their brand new stadium. 
            My favorite project was working with the owner of the West Michigan Whitecaps and Traverse City 
            Pitspitters minor league baseball teams. We conducted an Economic Impact Report for both teams, 
            analyzing the affect the teams have had on their respective communities through the use of economic 
            multipliers, and a spatial analysis of properties surrounding the stadium (I began development of 
            my python package SpatDAPy to support this project). I was able to present to both of these clients 
            which was a great experience.
            MSCG has taught me tons about team work, management, public speaking, time management, and much much 
            more.
