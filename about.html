            About Me
        </h1>
        <h3>Home Town</h3>
        <br/>
        <p>
            I was born and raised in Shelby Township, Michigan - a suburb about an hour
            from Detroit. In High School I participated varsity football (albiet poorly),
            took 10 AP Courses, was a member of National Honors Society, and graduated with
            the distinct honor of the Physical Education Departmental Award for my 7 semesters 
            of weight training courses (I was and am a bit of a gym addict).
        </p>
        <h3>Intersts</h3>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Besides the subjects I go into a ton of detail below about, there are a couple
            interests that I love to talk about and engage with more causally. I am a huge Star Wars
            Lord of the Rings, and Seinfeld (I know, I know, I am a 20 year old that loves Seinfeld)
            fan, and I love to talk about movies, shows, and books. I am also a huge history buff.
            Currenly I am geeking out over the Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, which is an 
            absolute masterpiece and I will not tolerate any slader of, and am watching Curb Your
            Enthusiasm as a result of my love for Larry David's type of humor. 
        </p>
        <h3>Fitness Background</h3>
        <br/>
        <p>
            I am extremely passionate about health and fitness. I found exercise through 
            athletics, but I truly began to appreciate and understand health and fitness 
            over the course of the Coronavirus Pandemic, where I was able to focus on my 
            own health to an extent that I had previous never been - resulting in a 60lbs
            weight loss. I am a huge advocate of using exercise along with healthy eating
            as a way to improve mental health, which I preach to my clients and friends.
        </p>
        <h3>Programming Background</h3>
        <br/>
        <p>
            I only developed my passion for programming in the last year and a half. I began
            my college career completely undecided, thinking I could do anything from Exercise
            Science to Sports Management to History. But, after a life altering diagnosis of 
            a Giant Cell Tumor in my right leg, I revaluated my academic goals. I spent Winter
            2022 completely unweight bearing and nearly bedridden from late Novemeber to early
            Febuary. During this time, I took a myriad of classes, which I was blessed to be driven
            to by the University Paratransit Service at the University of Michigan. Of those courses,
            the one I found myself enjoying the most was EECS 183, an introduction C++ course.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Sense then, I have taken a variety of courses, capped off last semester with the 
            notorious Data Structures and Algorithms course EECS 281, which I found to be the 
            most satifying course I have taken to this date, despite the extreme caffeine addiction
            I developed from it. This summer I am working for the Zettawatt Equivalent Pulse Laser System 
            National Science Foundation (NSF) Labratory at the University of Michigan, where I am doing
            Full-Stack Website development using Python-Flask, HTML, CSS, and Javascript to build a Web Portal
            Application. I have also worked on a variety of other projects - such as a Python Package (SpatDAPy),
            the Software Subteam for the SPARK Electric Motorcycle Student Project Team 
            (specifically CAN message hexidecimal conversion and graphical interpretation), and a variety of other
            projects. Without a doubt getting into programming has been one of the most rewarding experiences of
            my life, and if anyone out there is also reading this and looking to get started in programming, I would
            love to help so feel free to reach out!
        </p>
        <h3>My Tumor Story</h3>
        <br/>
        <p>
            In November of 2021, I was diagnosed with a Giant Cell Tumor in my right leg. I had been experiencing some
            serious pain in my right knee for several months, but attributed the pain to be a result of stress due to 
            marathon training throughout the first half of 2021. But, after a particularly painful run in early November, 
            where I attempted to walk without a limp that I had developed and was unable to do so, I decided to go to the 
            doctor, assuming an ACL injury. Well instead I was greeted with a Cancer scare... so much fun! Turns out I 
            was fortunate and found myself with a Giant Cell Tumor, which is a benign tumor that is not cancerous, but extremely 
            agressive. I was told that had I waited much longer I would have lost my entire leg. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            I spend late November through Febuary completely unable to bear weight, having received a couple surgeries, resulting 
            in a plate and 9 screws in my right leg, and a pretty narly scar. I was unable to walk, and spent most of my time in bed. 
            Througout this whole period I refused to take a semester off of school, being driven to class by the Unviersity 
            Paratransit Service. This period was mentally straining and tough for me, I felt alone and isolated after being 
            the most social I had been my entire life. I am grateful for the friends and family that supported me through this 
            time, without them I would have been lost.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Well, even after weight bearing began again, in April my tumor came back, albiet much smaller. I was told that surgery 
            was not a viable option again, but we could try a medication with high success rates. I was put on Denosumab, a medication 
            that is used to treat osteoporosis, but has been shown to be effective in treating Giant Cell Tumors. I am currently a year 
            out from my reoccurance and all is looking well as of my last scan. In fact I have began running again (the look on my 
            oncologist's face when I told her that was priceless). I am still on Denosumab, and will be indefinetly, which is not without 
            side effects, including fairly constant bone aches throuhout my body, which I struggle with but keep quite about.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            My reason in sharing this is not for sympathy, but to show that with a support system, a relentless attitude, and some 
            luck, you can get through anything life throws at you. However, I benefitted greatly from my support system, and I know 
            others must be dealing with similar issues without the same support system. So, if you are reading this and are dealing with 
            chronic illness, a massive tumor, or any other health issue, please reach out to me. I would love to talk and help in any way.
