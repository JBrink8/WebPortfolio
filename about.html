            About Me
        </h1>
        <h3>Home Town</h3>
        <br/>
        <p>
            I was born and raised in Shelby Township, Michigan - a suburb about an hour
            from Detroit. In High School I participated varsity football (albiet poorly),
            took 10 AP Courses, was a member of National Honors Society, and graduated with
            the distinct honor of the Physical Education Departmental Award for my 7 semesters 
            of weight training courses (I was and am a bit of a gym addict).
        </p>
        <h3>Intersts</h3>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Besides the subjects I go into a ton of detail below about, there are a couple
            interests that I love to talk about and engage with more causally. I am a huge Star Wars
            Lord of the Rings, and Seinfeld (I know, I know, I am a 19 year old that loves Seinfeld)
            fan, and I love to talk about movies, shows, and books. I am also a huge history buff.
            Currenly I am geeking out over the Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, which is an 
            absolute masterpiece and I will not tolerate any slader of, and am watching Curb Your
            Enthusiasm as a result of my love for Larry David's type of humor. 
        </p>
        <h3>Fitness Background</h3>
        <br/>
        <p>
            I am extremely passionate about health and fitness. I found exercise through 
            athletics, but I truly began to appreciate and understand health and fitness 
            over the course of the Coronavirus Pandemic, where I was able to focus on my 
            own health to an extent that I had previous never been - resulting in a 60lbs
            weight loss. I am a huge advocate of using exercise along with healthy eating
            as a way to improve mental health, which I preach to my clients and friends.
        </p>
        <h3>Programming Background</h3>
        <br/>
        <p>
            I only developed my passion for programming in the last year and a half. I began
            my college career completely undecided, thinking I could do anything from Exercise
            Science to Sports Management to History. But, after a life altering diagnosis of 
            a Giant Cell Tumor in my right leg, I revaluated my academic goals. I spent Winter
            2022 completely unweight bearing and nearly bedridden from late Novemeber to early
            Febuary. During this time, I took a myriad of classes, which I was blessed to be driven
            to by the University Paratransit Service at the University of Michigan. Of those courses,
            the one I found myself enjoying the most was EECS 183, an introduction C++ course.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Sense then, I have taken a variety of courses, capped off last semester with the 
            notorious Data Structures and Algorithms course EECS 281, which I found to be the 
            most satifying course I have taken to this date, despite the extreme caffeine addiction
            I developed from it. This summer I am working for the Zettawatt Equivalent Pulse Laser System 
            National Science Foundation (NSF) Labratory at the University of Michigan, where I am doing
            Full-Stack Website development using Python-Flask, HTML, CSS, and Javascript to build a Web Portal
            Application. I have also worked on a variety of other projects - such as a Python Package (SpatDAPy),
            the Software Subteam for the SPARK Electric Motorcycle Student Project Team 
            (specifically CAN message hexidecimal conversion and graphical interpretation), and a variety of other
            projects. Without a doubt getting into programming has been one of the most rewarding experiences of
            my life, and if anyone out there is also reading this and looking to get started in programming, I would
            love to help so feel free to reach out!

        <h3>My Tumor Story</h3>
        <p>
            I don't like to share this - ask my friends and family, I am a very private person. Hell, many of
            my friends I have made sense my diagnosis don't even know about it. But, and "About Me" section would
            be pretty bullshit without it. So, here it goes.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            In November of 2021, I was diagnosed with a Giant Cell Tumor in my right leg. I had been experiencing some
            serious pain in my right knee for several months - but having a history of surgery on my right knee, I chalked it
            up to reagrravating an old injury. Even after realizing it must be something more severe, my assumption was 
            that the worst it would be was a torn ligament, after all the pain began while I was training for a marathon, I 
            figured that was a reasonable explination for how it got hurt. I was also in my first semester of my freshman year
            of college, and I was not about to let knee pain keep me down, I knew people that delayed ACL surgery for years,
            what does it matter that my knee would randomly give out, that I had a slight limp, that I couldn't run, that if something
            touched my leg near the knee I would practically scream in pain. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            I was being stupid. Extremely stupid.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Finally, in November 2022 I went to my orthopedic surgeon, who handled my previous knee surgery, and he ordered an MRI.
            I went to the MRI, and the very next day, I got a call from my surgeon asking me to come in as soon as possible that day.
            The appointment had been scheduled for the next week, but he wanted me in that day. That was the first sign that 
            shit was bad. I remember sitting in the room, on one of those tables doctors have, and seeing the MRI on the screen. 
            I have no clue how to read an MRI, I have looked at them before and never been able to decern shit. Well, even I could
            see the massive discolored lump, that my doctor would reveal was the size of a softball and literally eating out of the 
            side of my femur.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            The next couple weeks the C word was my entire families mind. In fact one orthopedic oncologist I went to straight up 
            told me that he thought it was an Osteosarcom, and told me and my family to prepare for that. I Thank god I ended up 
            getting into see my current orthopedic oncologist at the University of Michigan, who talked down that stress a little bit,
            and after doing a biopsy revealed it was actually a one-in-a-million Giant Cell Tumor of the Bone. Hearing the word 
            "benign" after waiting several days for a biopsy results call is probably the most hardest I have happy cried in my
            life. After having an area the size of a softball scrapped out of my femur and reconstructed with bone cement, and the 
            addition of a plate and 9 screws to hold it all together, I was momentarily tumor free.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            But, the story doesn't end there. I was tumor free for about 6 months, before scans revealed that my tumor had came back. 
            However, this time it was caught early, a similar size to a peanut. I was told that surgery was not an option at that time,
            and I would be put on a medication that proved useful in inhibiting the tumors growth. As I am writting this I still
            receive this medication as a shot every month, which has some minor side effects, but is overall not too bad, and the tumor 
            presumably (knock on wood) doing well.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            The reason I want to share this story is that I have wanted to be a resourse for people, specifically previously young, healthy
            college students that have suddenly had to deal with chronic health issues. I really do not like opening up about this to people,
            but if I felt supper alone especially when dealing with the cancer scare part of it and the realization that my leg will never be
            the same, and I want to be a resource for people that are going through similar things. So, if you are reading this and you are
            going through a similar experience, please feel free to reach out to me, I would love to talk to you. Even if you don't want to reach
            out and are going through a similar experience, I hope this story can help you feel less alone. Also, this is not all gloom, 
            I did run my first 5k in 2 years last month, and have been scalling up running throuhout the last month. I am also planning on running
            a 10k next month. Am I as fast as before? Hell no. But I have found a new normal, and I hope others can as well. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            So yeah, that is my tumor story. I hope it helps someone out there. Big shout out to my family, and friends for helping me 
            through this, and to my doctors for saving my leg. Also shout out to the Hank Green, one of the Youtube Creators behind
            Crash Course and so many other channels I grew up on that currently opened up to the entire internet about having cancer, his sharing
            is what inspired me to share my story with my tromatic health experience.
