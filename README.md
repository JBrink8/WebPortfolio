<h1>Project Goal</h1>
<p>
  The goal of this project is to create a digital platform for myself to show my interests, keep up to date about what 
  I am doing, and occassional make the blog post.

  The original goal was frankly just to make a digital resume, but now I find myself wanting to transform this into my own 
  web homepage. In that I would like to house most the things I like to use the web for on this page. I will soon begin creating 
  basic front end games like 2048, Blackjack, and more. Eventually, I hope to build a backend to function as a web application that can 
  make calls to other APIs and hopefully do some really cool stuff.
